This is the base CIBSE Algorithm. This is differentiated from the Sin 14 R-1 Algorithm solely by the time assumption for maximum solar radiation.

This assumption is endogenous in the base data that a user would enter into this function.

For more info on underlying assumptions between algorithms read D.H.C. Chow and G. J. Levermore (2007). 

#CIBSE
CIBSE <- function(t,timemin,timemax,tempmin,tempmax) {
  if(t<timemin){
  f1 = (cos(pi*(timemin - t)/24 + timemin - timemax) + 1)/2
  }
  else if (timemin < t & t < timemax){
  f1 = (cos(pi*(t - timemin)/timemax - timemin) + 1)/2
  }
  else if (timemin < t){
  f1 = (cos(pi*(24 + timemin - t)/24 + timemin - timemax) + 1)/2
  }
  
  else{
    print("ERROR T is messed up")
  }
 
  f2 = (1 - f1)
  
  temp = (f1 * tempmin) + (f2 * tempmax)
  
  return (temp)
}
